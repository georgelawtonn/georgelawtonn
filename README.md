## ðŸš€ About Me

My name is George Lawton, and I am pursuing a computer science degree at Northeastern University. I have developed skills in software engineering, database design, and artificial intelligence. Through coursework and teaching experience, I have developed my analytical thinking, creativity, and perseverance and gained experience with languages like Java, Python, and SQL. My career goals are to work as a software or database engineer while exploring artificial intelligence. Eventually, I hope to make a positive impact on the world by leveraging my interests to build products that improve people's lives.

Outside of tech, I push myself to develop new skills and like to attempt a plethora of different things. My current hobbies include skiing, running, putting together keyboards, and the occasional video game. 

On another note, some projects may be viewed on request only.
